# HV-ProgramsAndAssignments 

## Introduction

Welcome to the HV-ProgramsAndAssignments repository! This repository contains my Java and Python projects and assignments. Here, I have documented my journey in learning and implementing various programming concepts in these two popular programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### JAVA

This directory contains all my Java projects and assignments. Each project is organized into its own folder and includes the source code, necessary files, and any additional documentation.

### PYTHON

In this directory, you will find my Python projects and assignments. Just like in the Java section, each project is organized in its own folder with the relevant code and documentation.
